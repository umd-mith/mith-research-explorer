Simple server-side scripting allows users to populate the Lightbox applet in any number of ways. The application version, which was developed earlier, allows users to share images in peer-to-peer fashion: all users participating in a common session see the same images in the same on-screen configuration at the same time. Movement of an image and other operations are all globally propagated in realtime. Thus the application version functions as an image-based whiteboard.","website":"http:\/\/mith.umd.edu\/lightbox\/","start":"2002-10-01","end":"2004-02-01","member":[{"name":"Matthew Kirschenbaum","affiliation":"University of Maryland"},{"name":"Susan Schreibman","affiliation":"University of Maryland"},{"name":"Amit Kumar","affiliation":"University of Maryland"},{"name":"Eric White","affiliation":"University of Maryland"},{"name":"Jerzy W.
