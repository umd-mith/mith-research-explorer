The site gathers links to other recent MITH projects in born-digital cultural heritage, and serves as a clearing house for our expanding portfolio in this area.

Based on the core premise that creativity is not necessarily a state of grace rooted in innate talent or skill, a series of seminars were offered through the University's 'Teachers as Scholars' program, in which teacher participants explored their own life narratives as doorways to creativity against a backdrop of parallel stories from other cultures. Dr. Robertson worked with a MITH programmer to develop an interactive website with malleable texts, sounds and images as the dynamic outcome of this process.",

Using advanced computational methods, this project challenges longstanding critical assumptions about ekphrasis.",

In Corpora Space, scholars can discover, analyze and curate digital texts across the 450 years of print culture in English from 1473 until 1923, along with the texts from the Classical world upon which that print culture is based.

These questions are especially vital when social media data is being used to study social justice issues.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop we\u2019ll review basic research ethics for public datasets, and then discuss unsolved ethical challenges for the use of Twitter data. We will also discuss strategies for ensuring best-effort ethical approaches in this emerging research space. We\u2019ll also consider Twitter datasets as materials for current and future archives\u2014how is this medium redefining archival sources and notions of historical evidence? If we think of this data as part of a historical record does that change our evaluation of how the collection of data we have reflects actual public sentiments (its representativeness), and what biases might it reflect or contain in its construction. Who/what is being remembered, and who/what is being forgotten, when we study and preserve such data? And, finally, in order to facilitate active research now and maintain this data into the future we\u2019ll cover basic strategies for managing and maintaining social media data collected as part of research.\r\n\r\n<del>Please RSVP at <a href=\"http://ter.ps/dhinc31\" target=\"_blank\">http://ter.ps/dhinc31</a>.</del>",

This workshop will help you do that by describing the anatomy of a Tweet, the mechanics of JSON data, and how to write a simple program to process the data. Learning how to dig into your Twitter dataset is an important step as you plan for some of the more advanced tools we will learn about in Session V. Participants in this workshop will come away with a better understanding of processing Twitter JSON data, and be able to programmatically explore the data with simple open source tools. This is a hands-on workshop, so in order to participate fully, please bring a personal laptop with you. You should also try to download and install Python and JQ (both are available free, see links below). We also recommend installing a text editor such as <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sublime Text</a>.\r\n\r\nPython: <a href=\"https://www.python.org/downloads/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.python.org/downloads/\r\n</a>JQ: <a href=\"https://stedolan.github.io/jq/\" target=\"_blank\">https://stedolan.github.io/jq/</a>",

Building on the previous sessions, we will demonstrate how temporal, network, sentiment, and geographic analyses on a subset of the Ferguson Twitter can aid understanding and enhance storytelling of a controversial event. These demonstrations will include hands-on exercises on categorizing tweets by location (from inside/outside Ferguson, MO) and sentiment (positive or negative language), visualizing the different groups of people taking part in the discussion, and detecting compelling moments in the data. This workshop will also introduce participants to tools and environments for performing such analysis independently and on other Twitter data sets, so participants should come prepared with a laptop. Workshop participants will gain skills in:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Network Analysis</li>\r\n\t<li>Sentiment Analysis</li>\r\n\t<li>Event Detection</li>\r\n\t<li>Data Storytelling</li>\r\n\t<li>Includes hands on demonstration of tools</li>\r\n\t<li>Data Visualization with NodeXL</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<del>Please RSVP at <a href=\"http://ter.ps/dhinc5\">http://ter.ps/dhinc5.</a></del>",

        "description": "Langston Terrace is the nation's first public housing program built in Washington, D.C. Opened in 1937, Langston Terrace housed Black low-income, working class families; it was one of 51 racially segregated projects built by the Public Works Administration as part of the New Deal. In collaboration with Kelly Quinn from UMD's Department of American Studies, MITH staff assisted with the creation of a website, Learning from Langston Terrace, which sought to commemorate the history of the community by compiling and offering primary sources for visitors. The materials on the site were meant to augment user's experiences and memories of Langston and the scholarly literature. ",

The applet version, which is newly developed, furnishes what we believe to be an extremely flexible environment for online image comparison. Its primary audience is developers who wish to add an image comparison tool to a Web-based image collection. Simple server-side scripting allows users to populate the Lightbox applet in any number of ways. The application version, which was developed earlier, allows users to share images in peer-to-peer fashion: all users participating in a common session see the same images in the same on-screen configuration at the same time. Movement of an image and other operations are all globally propagated in realtime. Thus the application version functions as an image-based whiteboard.",
